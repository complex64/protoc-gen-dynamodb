# Introduction

Annotations are special tags that can be added to your Protocol Buffer messages
to provide additional information about the structure and purpose of the
message.

To generate DynamoDB bindings for any of your messages, you must include
the [document annotation](https://protoc-gen-dynamodb.complex64.dev/annotations/message#document).
